#Question : Write a while loop that compares the player's guess to our number. If the player guesses correctly, break from the loop. Otherwise, tell the player if they're warmer or colder, and continue asking for guesses.


#Answer :
while True:

    # we can copy the code from above to take an input
    guess = int(input("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\n  What is your guess? "))
    
    if guess < 1 or guess > 100:
        print('OUT OF BOUNDS! Please try again: ')
        continue
    
    # here we compare the player's guess to our number
    if guess == num:
        print(f'CONGRATULATIONS, YOU GUESSED IT IN ONLY {len(guesses)} GUESSES!!')
        break
        
    # if guess is incorrect, add guess to the list
    guesses.append(guess)
    
    # when testing the first guess, guesses[-2]==0, which evaluates to False
    # and brings us down to the second section
    
    if guesses[-2]:  
        if abs(num-guess) < abs(num-guesses[-2]):
            print('WARMER!')
        else:
            print('COLDER!')
   
    else:
        if abs(num-guess) <= 10:
            print('WARM!')
        else:
            print('COLD!')
